# subsetsAnimation

View this project in action: https://buggi22.github.io/subsetsAnimation

This project displays a simple animation illustrating an algorithm for generating all possible subsets of size k taken from the set {1, ..., n}.

For a more detailed description of the underlying algorithm, see:
* The Rosetta Code entry for [lexicographic ordered generation of combinations](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Combinations#Lexicographic_ordered_generation)
* *Combinatorics: Topics, Techniques, Algorithms* by Peter J. Cameron (1994), Algorithm 3.12.3 on page 43.

Note to self: [this blog post](http://brettterpstra.com/2012/09/26/github-tip-easily-sync-your-master-to-github-pages/) was useful for syncing the master branch to GitHub pages.
